# Burp-Suite-Security-Testing
üîç Burp Suite Security Testing Project üõ°Ô∏è

In this project, I delved into the world of web application security using Burp Suite‚Äîa powerful tool for identifying vulnerabilities. The primary focus was to understand and utilize the core features of Burp Suite, including Proxy, Repeater, and Scanner, to test and enhance web application security.

What I Did in the Project 
Intercepted HTTP Traffic : Configured Burp Proxy to capture HTTP requests and responses between the browser and server. This allowed me to analyze and understand how data flows through the application.
Modified HTTP Requests : Manipulated intercepted requests to simulate various scenarios, such as unauthorized access or price manipulation in a POST request.
Analyzed HTTP History : Reviewed and filtered HTTP logs to identify anomalies and focus on vulnerabilities within the application's scope.
Used Burp Repeater : Reissued and tweaked HTTP requests iteratively to test the server's responses to unexpected inputs.
Practiced in a Controlled Environment : Exploited vulnerabilities in a deliberately vulnerable web application provided by Web Security Academy, ensuring hands-on learning without risks.
Key Outcomes 
Achievements: Successfully identified vulnerabilities like pricing manipulation and data exposure. 
Challenges: Overcame initial struggles with intercepting traffic and managing repetitive requests through meticulous adjustments. 
Learning: Enhanced my understanding of secure coding, input validation, and the critical role of proactive vulnerability assessments.
